# Code-Refactor

## Description

The Code-Refactor was created to make an exsisting site more accessable. Web accessibility is an important consideration for businesses as it ensures people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies.

A way of doing this is using semantic html so the website layout is easier to read and understand.

## Usage

Each section contains semantic html. If you open DevTools elements you can see the different types of semantic html used to create the layout of the page. On this website we used header, footer, section, aside and figure as shown in the screenshot.
